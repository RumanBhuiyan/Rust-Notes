compiled languages : C, C++, Go, Rust etc
interpreted languages : Python, Javascript, Ruby etc

                Compiled languages
          -------------------------------
Compiled languages are compiled into executable .exe file so that any machine can run that exe file.
That means after compiling, any machine can run that exe file no matters that machine has
C++/Go/Rust installed or not. As compiled languages makes machine understandable binary code for machine
that's why these are faster than interpreted languages. Due to any change in source we have to regenerate
the exe file again after compiling

                Interpreted Languages
            ----------------------------
Interpreted languages instructions are read line by line and then get executed and interacts with
user in terminal so there is no need of an exe file to interact with user in case of interpreted languages.
For running any file of interpreted languages machine must have installed that language.
