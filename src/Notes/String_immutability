Why strings are immutable by default ?
---------------------------------------

Before exploring the answer of this question let's first understand the definition of string.
So what is string ?

Most people say that strings is an array of characters. It's false.
Actually Strings is an array of bytes which represent characters using UTF-8 character encoding.

Some greek or latin letters or alphabets take 2 or 3  bytes to represent only single alphabet. In these case
if we change any of the byte value randomly then those bytes combine generate a different character than
what it was before changing bytes value. That's why Rust doesn't allow programmer to change bytes value.
