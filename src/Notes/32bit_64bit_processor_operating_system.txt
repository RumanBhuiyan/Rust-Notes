If your computer has 32-bit processor then it has = 2^32 number of memory locations
        = 2^32
        = 4294967296 bits
        = 4194304 Kilo-bytes (KB)
        = 4096 Mega-bytes (MB)
        = 4 Giga-bytes (GB)

That means your computer can take RAM of 4GB at max when running applications.

when we open an application then that application loads into RAM from ROM and get started executing
from RAM. If your computer is x86 or 32 bit then it means that your computer has 32-bit processor
which can't take more than 4GB RAM at the time of running all applications.


If your computer has 64-bit processor then it has = 2^64 number of memory locations
        = 2^64
        = 18446744073709551616 bits
        = 18014398509481984 Kilo-bytes (KB)
        = 17592186044416 Mega-bytes (MB)
        = 17179869184 Giga-bytes (GB)
        = 16777216 Tera-bytes (TB)
        = 16384 Peta-bytes (PB)
        = 16 Exa-Bytes (EB)

That means your computer can take RAM of 16 Exa-Bytes at max when running applications.
