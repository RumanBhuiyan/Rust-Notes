cargo build => build your cargo project which means generate your project .exe file

cargo run => build your project and load .exe file into terminal that's why it takes
                more time than 'cargo build' and 'cargo check'

cargo check => compiles your code and checks is there any problem, error or not
                it doesn't load .exe file that's why it's faster than above 2 command.
                Every Rustaceans use 'cargo check' to check their code compiled or not
                and if everything is ok then they run 'cargo run' finally.
