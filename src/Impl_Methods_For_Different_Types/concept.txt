In Rust, We can implement methods for types like struct, enum, tuple-struct etc.
         using directly impl like

         impl <struct_name>{
            //methods
         }

But we can't implement methods directly like above for primitive types like i32, f32 etc.

It's a matter of joy that we can implement trait for any type. Rust allows it.
So the safer way of implementing methods for any type is declaring trait first
then implementing methods for that the type
